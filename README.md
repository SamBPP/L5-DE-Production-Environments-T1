# Level 5 Data Engineer Production Environments

This document outlines the stages of development for this project, detailing the progression from initial prototyping to full-scale production.

## 1. Prototype/MVP
- **Objective**: Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to validate the core functionality.
- **Activities**:
    - Define the problem and scope.
    - Implement basic functionality to demonstrate feasibility.
    - Focus on rapid iteration and feedback.

## 2. Refinement and Modularisation
- **Objective**: Refactor the codebase for maintainability and scalability.
- **Activities**:
    - Break down the code into reusable modules.
    - Improve code readability and structure.
    - Optimise performance and address technical debt.

## 3. Testing
- **Objective**: Ensure the reliability and correctness of the system.
- **Activities**:
    - Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
    - Use tools like `pytest` for automated testing.
    - Perform manual testing for edge cases.

## 4. Automation and Airflow
- **Objective**: Automate workflows and integrate with Apache Airflow for orchestration.
- **Activities**:
    - Create CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.
    - Use Airflow to schedule and monitor workflows.
    - Automate repetitive tasks to improve efficiency.

## 5. Monitoring
- **Objective**: Maintain system health and ensure smooth operation in production.
- **Activities**:
    - Set up monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana.
    - Implement logging and alerting mechanisms.
    - Regularly review system metrics and logs.

This structured approach ensures a robust and scalable solution, ready for production deployment.
